1. What is the grid?
The Grid is a layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex grid structures for arranging elements in rows and columns. It provides a two-dimensional layout system, allowing you to precisely position items within rows and columns.


2. What is the difference between Flex and grid?
The main difference between Flexbox and Grid lies in their layout models:
* Flexbox:
   * Works in one dimension (either as a row or a column).
   * Suitable for arranging items within a single row or column, or changing the order of items.
   * Best suited for layout structures where items need to be aligned in one direction.
* Grid:
   * Works in two dimensions (rows and columns).
   * Allows you to define both rows and columns and position items within the grid.
   * Ideal for creating complex layout structures with both rows and columns, such as grids with headers, footers, and content areas.




3. How can you define rows and columns of your grid?
To define rows and columns of a grid, you can use the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties, respectively. For example:


.grid-container {
 display: grid;
 grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Define two rows with heights of 100px and 200px */
 grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; /* Define two columns with widths in a ratio of 1:2 */
}






4. List any two properties of grid item and grid container.
Two properties of the grid item (grid) and the grid container (grid-container) are:
Grid Item (Child):
* grid-row: Specifies the row position of the grid item within the grid.
* grid-column: Specifies the column position of the grid item within the grid.
Grid Container (Parent):
* grid-template-rows: Defines the size of the rows in the grid container.
* grid-template-columns: Defines the size of the columns in the grid container.
